## What is it

As the focus on beauty and convenience, this project came up with two intentions, the first is to learn more about blockchain and transactions and the second is because I didn't find places that have practicality and beauty on a website, free of course, paid I found .
So I decided to create this project that until now has no name, suggestions are accepted.
